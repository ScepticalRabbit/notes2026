# Project Specification: Generative Speckle Patterns

## Background & Motivation

Experiments used to validate the performance of fusion engineering components are often large, time consuming, technically challenging and expensive. It is therefore desirable to maximise the information obtained from limited experimental campaigns through the use of full-field, image-based measurement techniques such as digital image correlation (DIC).

To maximise the value of DIC measurements, experimental configurations should be designed and assessed before significant experimental campaigns are undertaken. This requires simulation tools capable of predicting the expected performance of the measurement system, identifying important sources of uncertainty and quantifying systematic measurement errors arising from the experimental configuration.

Synthetic imaging simulations are a key tool for characterising systematic measurement uncertainties in DIC. In a synthetic imaging workflow, a known deformation field is applied to a virtual specimen and synthetic camera images are generated. The images can then be processed using the same DIC algorithms that will be used experimentally. Because the underlying deformation field is known exactly, errors introduced by the imaging and measurement process can be isolated and quantified.

A key source of uncertainty in DIC is the speckle pattern applied to the specimen surface. Speckle size, shape, density, contrast, spatial distribution and spatial frequency content can all influence the accuracy and robustness of DIC measurements. Consequently, realistic representation of experimental speckle patterns is important when using synthetic imaging to predict experimental measurement uncertainty.

It is desirable to use images of real experimental speckle patterns as the basis for these simulations because they directly encode characteristics of the actual experimental process, including irregular speckle shapes, clustering, variations in density, edge characteristics and other features that may be difficult to reproduce using simple procedural models.

However, experimentally acquired images are inherently discrete and spatially sampled by the camera sensor. Directly mapping these images into a synthetic imaging simulation therefore introduces the sampling and interpolation characteristics of the original image into the virtual experiment. These discretisation effects can themselves introduce parasitic numerical bias and make it difficult to separate errors originating from the experimental speckle pattern from errors introduced by its digital representation.

A tool is therefore required that can analyse one or more experimental images of a speckle pattern, infer the characteristics of the underlying continuous stochastic pattern and generate new representations that reproduce those characteristics without directly reproducing the discretisation of the input image.

The resulting speckle representation should either:

* generate a new high resolution image that is statistically and metrologically equivalent to the experimental pattern; or
* provide parameters for a procedural or analytic speckle model capable of generating a continuous representation of a statistically or metrologically equivalent pattern.

The generated pattern should not be interpreted as recovering the unique underlying high resolution experimental pattern. Information lost through optical blur and sensor sampling cannot generally be recovered uniquely. Instead, the objective is to generate new realisations that are statistically and metrologically consistent with the observed experimental pattern and reproduce its relevant behaviour when used for DIC simulation.

## Aims & Objectives

The aim of this project is to develop a suite of software tools for characterising experimental DIC speckle patterns and generating new high resolution and/or continuous speckle fields that reproduce the important characteristics of a pattern supplied by the user.

The fundamental problem to be addressed is:

> **Given an undersampled experimental image of a stochastic speckle pattern, infer the statistical characteristics of the underlying speckle field and generate new, higher resolution realisations that are statistically and metrologically equivalent to that field.**

An important secondary question is whether generative machine learning models provide a measurable advantage over conventional statistical characterisation and procedural reconstruction techniques.

The objectives of the project are to:

* Identify the image and spatial statistics that are important for characterising experimental DIC speckle patterns and their resulting measurement uncertainties.
* Develop software for automatically extracting these characteristics from experimental images.
* Investigate conventional statistical and optimisation based approaches for fitting procedural speckle generators to experimental patterns.
* Investigate machine learning approaches for learning compact representations of experimental speckle characteristics.
* Investigate generative models capable of producing new high resolution speckle patterns conditioned on one or more experimental reference images.
* Determine whether generated patterns reproduce the statistical properties of the reference experimental patterns - *Statisical Equivalence*.
* Determine whether generated patterns reproduce the DIC measurement behaviour of the reference experimental patterns - *Metrological Equivalence*.
* Quantify the effect of input image resolution, optical blur, noise and other imaging parameters on the inferred speckle characteristics.
* Provide uncertainty estimates or multiple plausible pattern realisations where the available experimental image does not uniquely constrain the underlying high resolution pattern.
* Integrate the resulting methods into `PyVale` through a verified, performant, documented, tested and user friendly software interface.

All work for this project should be undertaken in this github repo as a staging post and standalone research python package code before final integration into `PyVale`: https://github.com/Computer-Aided-Validation-Laboratory/specklemimic.

## Speckle Generation Methods

The project should consider two complementary approaches to reproducing experimental speckle patterns.

### Procedural Reconstruction

In this approach, the experimental image is analysed and a set of parameters is estimated for an existing or newly developed procedural speckle generator.

Parameters may describe characteristics such as:

* speckle density;
* speckle size distribution;
* speckle intensity distribution;
* background intensity;
* contrast;
* speckle aspect ratio;
* orientation distribution;
* speckle edge sharpness;
* minimum speckle spacing;
* clustering;
* overlap behaviour;
* spatial anisotropy;
* multi-scale pattern characteristics.

The resulting parameters can then be used by `PyVale` to generate arbitrary resolution or continuous speckle fields. This approach has the advantage that the resulting representation is interpretable, compact and potentially independent of any machine learning model once the parameters have been inferred.

### Direct Generative Reconstruction

In this approach, a machine learning model generates a new high resolution speckle pattern directly from one or more reference images. The generated output should not simply interpolate or super resolve the original pixels. Instead, it should generate a new realisation from a statistical distribution conditioned on the supplied experimental pattern. Different random seeds should therefore be capable of producing multiple distinct patterns that retain the relevant statistical characteristics of the input. The model should ideally support arbitrary or configurable output resolution rather than being restricted to a single fixed image size.

## Speckle Pattern Characterisation

An initial part of the project should determine which statistical descriptors are required to distinguish experimentally relevant DIC speckle patterns. Candidate descriptors should include the following but a literature search of the relevant DIC literature will be required to make this list comprehensive. A sensitivity study will be required to down sample thes to the most relevant parameters for *Statistical Equivalence* and *Metrological Equivalence* of speckle patterns.

### Intensity Statistics

* mean intensity;
* intensity variance;
* intensity histogram;
* dynamic range;
* foreground/background intensity;
* contrast;
* saturation and clipping characteristics.

### Speckle Morphology

Where individual speckles can be identified:

* speckle area;
* equivalent diameter;
* major and minor dimensions;
* aspect ratio;
* eccentricity;
* orientation;
* perimeter;
* circularity;
* edge sharpness;
* overlap between neighbouring speckles.

### Spatial Statistics

The project should investigate descriptors capable of characterising the spatial arrangement of speckles, including:

* autocorrelation;
* spatial correlation length;
* radial distribution statistics;
* nearest neighbour distance;
* clustering;
* minimum spacing or exclusion distance;
* spatial anisotropy;
* local speckle density variations.

### Spatial Frequency Statistics

The frequency content of a speckle pattern is likely to be particularly important for DIC and may be characterised using quantities such as:

* two dimensional power spectra;
* radially averaged power spectra;
* directional frequency content;
* dominant spatial scales;
* multi-scale frequency characteristics.

### DIC Specific Characteristics

The project should also investigate whether generic image statistics are sufficient to predict DIC behaviour. Additional descriptors may include:

* image gradient magnitude;
* image gradient orientation;
* local intensity variation;
* local pattern entropy;
* spatial frequency content relative to pixel spacing;
* frequency content relative to DIC subset size;
* characteristics of the DIC correlation surface;
* sensitivity of displacement estimates to pattern variations.

---

### WP7 — DIC Validation
